    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Master‚Äôs researcher passionate about the future of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 at the intersection of AI, digital engineering, and the Internet of Things. My current work, as part of the Erasmus Mundus Meta 4.0 program, explores intelligent manufacturing pipelines using machine vision, feature recognition, and data-driven automation strategies at ARC Solutions GmbH.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research is grounded in the integration of digital manufacturing and materials science, with the goal of building adaptive systems that drive efficiency and resilience in production environments. I focus on designing AI-powered frameworks to automate complex workflows and boost industrial performance in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive on combining deep analytical knowledge with cross-functional collaboration. With a multidisciplinary foundation in additive manufacturing, design, materials characterization, and machine learning, I translate complex engineering challenges into clear, actionable solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my technical work, I am the founder of <strong>BIGinitiative</strong>. This platform empowers students and early-career engineers to connect, share bold ideas, and shape their high-tech career paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests extend beyond engineering into storytelling and communication. I explore the human side of technology through narrative writing, using storytelling to spark curiosity and conversation around innovation, identity, and impact.
